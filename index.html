    <p> While the dictionary shows that a diagram is defined as a "simplified drawing showing the appearance or structure of something", this week's reading <em>The Mechanisms of Meaning</em> help shine a new light on the term. Specifically, after reading about diagrams throughout the article, I was better able to see a clearer relationship between diagrams and meaning. From the reading, I was able to recognize that a diagram is indeed like it's dictionary definition; however, it also can serve as a more elaborate illustration that can communicate something deeper than a systematic, concrete picture. Arakawa supports this relationship between diagrams and meaning by suggesting that diagrams are "in the service of the mind" and are "moving pictures of thought".

	Understanding the relationship between diagrams and meaning helps define the difference between diagrams created as art versus those created not for art. I believe that diagrams created for art are more subjective and open for the viewer's mind's own interpretation while non-art diagrams re more informational and objective than they are "creative".  With diagrams created for art, there is more room for creative ambiguity-- something that can be seen when observing the work Ambiguous Zones of a Lemon. I think that diagrams used as art have a similar effect that Arakawa's paintings had on Calvino-- having a provoking effect that makes a viewer feel as if it's mind is "like the picture." Diagrams used for art test the limits of thought and logic, while non-art diagrams are more traditional and remain within a more neutral, normalized range.

Diagrams, maps, and networks are similar in respect to their informational nature. Personally, I feel networks are more systematic than diagrams, while maps are more directional than diagrams.

    <p> Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism is extremely relevant in this day and age. Her belief that the key to stability comes with the pursuit of individual happiness, not the concern for a collective society is prevalent in the 21st century.

When learning about Rand's philosophy throughout the documentary, it was easy to make a direct connection between her beliefs and those of the current conservative political atmosphere under Trump's administration. Specifically, President Trump's views on the deregulation of government interference within American businesses and its myriad of industries is consistent with Rand's philosophy of objectivism. The current emphasis on the free-market within America, as well the individualistic success of each business and industry, is consistent with Rand's belief that a nation's stability is dependent on self-interest.

	I also think that the popularity of modern day culture to be successful shows how Objectivism is still very much prevalent today. Despite the appearance of working towards the common good, I feel like most individual's have a selfish mentality-- even subconsciously- when it comes to maintaining "stability". Everyone seemingly has their own personal agenda, despite looking like they are working on behalf of everyone on the exterior.

The Internet is greatly shaped by Objectivism. The freedom of information that circulates within the Internet's elaborate and complex network reflects the "unintervened" nature of Objectivism. The power to create on the internet also suggests its self-focused nature. Every web developer or anyone who even participates or creates on the internet personally contributes to shaping the Internet as a whole. This freedom within the internet also leads to its difficulty to regulate. Despite efforts to maintain data security and legal rights within the Internet, the rise of piracy and the ability to reproduce and redistribute what is created within the Internet makes it nearly impossible to totally regulate and makes it quite difficult for outside parties, such as the government, to intervene.

The products of the internet also reflect how it was ultimately shaped by Objectivism. Blogs, social media platforms, forums, etc. all provide individualistic experiences for Internet users. The ability for free speech and content creation for a personal agenda on these platforms shows similarities to Rand's philosophy of self-interest. </p>

  <p> Materiality is manifested in poor images due to the concrete aspect that is associated with a “poor image”. For example, the quality of an image can have a direct association with a class position-- a category usually distributed to material items. Poor images, usually due to their lack of focus and lack of status reflect a lower social class and thus, lower value, than those of a better, higher quality. Materiality manifested through a poor image is best exemplified through the ever popular modern-day meme culture.
Despite “meme” images being unclear, heavily manipulated, or even incoherent at times, they succeed in communicating a message and relaying an idea that transcends the poor quality and that is easy to identify in popular culture. What interests me the most about poor images-- specifically memes-- is how despite their lack of typically assumed aesthetics, they can still provoke such a widespread understood reaction. Specifically, it is interesting how poor images can even outperform their pre-manipulated, “more aesthetic nature” in terms of establishing a connection with their audience and manifesting an emotional response.
This reading—specifically the author’s discussion on Imperfect Cinema—got me to reflect and question whether or not some parodies would be considered poor images. I question this as some parodies, whether it be a parodized film or even a parodized movie photo, are usually extremely low quality productions and also, the majority of the times, are considered to hold lower value, despite being accepted in modern-day culture. </p>

  <p> As stated by Rauschenberg himself, time is essential in the creation and analysis of his work. Firstly, time is important as the elements used throughout his work are described as having a time “delay”. In order to truly understand the essence of his collages, Rauschenberg believes they are best encountered and understood over a certain period of time, in order to achieve a “fully durational” artistic experience.” The key to “listening’ to Rauschenberg's work is time itself.  I also believe that Rauschenberg's work can be seen through a similar light as the internet. Similar to Rauschenberg’s work, the internet can be seen as a form of unique collage. Images found on the internet also are removed “from the space of the world” and are relocated and installed in the new entirely different space of the internet. Just as Rauschenberg's work was analyzed, it can be said that this transferred content found on the internet “transcends reality” as they too are just “projections” that can be manipulated. Also, I was able to recognize a similarity between Rauschenberg’s collages and the internet, as the way you analyze it compared to other forms of media varies drastically. </p>

  <p> In analysis of cybernetics and modern-day reality, I believe that the majority of individuals strives for a sense of external equilibrium in the sense of peace and equality for all; therefore, the ideology of cybernetics in perfect practice seems probable. However, in light of events that actually occur in reality, just by turning on the news you see that this is not how life actually plans out, despite a range of attempts. Because of this, I do not believe cybernetics is an accurate tool to describe the entirety of reality.


Role within a larger “global” ecosystem or even local thing  own contributions towards culture

Yes but only in a more basic and simplified manner
Cyber: idea that everything can be seen as systems w interconnected networks o energy that are regulated and governed by feedback
Machine, nature and human are regulated in same manner
In theory human act like nature and stabilize itself
Realty comps cannot predibct change and dynamism in general
Ecosystems do not reselt to their oriinal state and evolution
Commune failure
Use cybernetics to think about what reality could be/ideology focused
Undersand we aren’t center and universe is bigger than us
Responabsility is essential have to live in cooexistence </p>

<p> After hearing this podcast, it was made clearer to me parallels between Postmodernist Philosopher Foucault’s own views and Cybernetics. Specifically, Foucault’s book “Discipline and Punishment” and the system of punishment and control over prisoners that was introduced in the 1700s peaked my interest and allowed me to think about human-driven regulation and their establishment of this sometimes inhumane system of control through the perspective of cybernetics. Foucault’s acceptance of the sovereign’s behavior shows not only his acceptance of this inhumane “social contract” but also how his personal values aligned with the checks and societal control under cybernetics.

I am in agreement with Foucault that our own modern lives are shaped through similar systems of control. The examples mentioned in the podcast, such as corporations and universities, are similar to the ways I personally experience the systems of control introduced by Foucault. While of course they are on a complete other end of the system, something that I feel at time hinders my own personal and creative freedom. Despite this, I am also extremely aware that this system of control-- although from a student or employee’s perspective at times can seem quite frustrating and unfair—is an essential key towards to the smooth-running success of the organization or mini-society. I also really identified with his example regarding the media consume. I think, unconsciously and at times very discreetly, the media we are exposed to every day without a doubt have an influence in controlling the way we think and behave; therefore, it is acceptable to fall under the label of a system of cybernetics. It is nearly impossible to escape this system, especially due to the constant surveillance we as digital humans succumb to. </p>

Lyotard’s “Can Thought Go On Without A Body?” was an incredibly interesting read in my opinion, especially as the topic of artificial intelligence is prominent in the majority. With artificial intelligence on the rise, I definitely do agree that it is possible for thought to go on without a body--computers being a central example for that clause. Programmers—specifically in the realm of artificial intelligence--  in this modern era are the ones developing code and thus programming the “thought” behind these AI machines and computers. It can be said that, because their own thought process is applied in the development of what the machine will ultimately call upon to exemplify their own “answers”, the programmer’s thought lives on outside of their physical body or “corporeal hardware”.

I do not believe that Lytord’s perspective on suffering, however, fits in this perspective regarding machine thinking. Lytord believes that there cannot be thought without suffering. This brings into question whether independently thinking machines—such as artificially intelligent computers and gadgets-- can be an accurate example of Lytord’s argument regarding thought. I do, however, believe that the thought process behind those “with a body” versus those “without” differ.
